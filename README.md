# How To Shrink Image Files

This repo contains my exploration of how to go about creating the
smallest possible image files.  This is done in the context of the
Raspberry Pi- more specifically, trying to shrink the Raspbian Image
after the standard Raspbian OS has been updated and configured to suit
certain purposes.
